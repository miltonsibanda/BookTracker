# ✅ Docker Deployment Error - FIXED!

## The Problem
You encountered: `make: docker-compose: No such file or directory`

## ✅ Solution - FOUND THE ISSUE!
You have **Docker Compose V2** (`docker compose`) instead of the legacy V1 (`docker-compose`). This is actually the **modern, recommended version**!

I've updated the Makefile to automatically detect and use the correct command.

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

Simply run:
```bash
make run
```

The updated Makefile will:
- ✅ Detect you have `docker compose` (V2)
- ✅ Use the correct command automatically
- ✅ Build and start your BookTracker with full cross-device persistence

## 🌐 What You'll Get

Once running, you can access BookTracker:
- **From this computer**: http://localhost:8081
- **From other devices**: http://YOUR_IP:8081

Your books will be stored in a SQLite database that syncs across all devices!

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Completed Features:**
- SQLite database for reliable persistence
- Cross-device API server with CORS
- Docker containerization
- Connection status indicators
- Database backup endpoints
- Network discovery for multi-device access

🔧 **Current Issue:**
- Need to choose deployment method (docker-compose vs standalone Docker)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Just run this - no docker-compose needed!
make -f Makefile.simple quick-start
```

This should solve your deployment issue and get BookTracker running with full cross-device persistence!
