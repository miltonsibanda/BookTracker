# 🌐 BookTracker Cross-Device Persistence Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Previously**: Books were stored only in browser localStorage, making them inaccessible from other devices or browsers.

**Now**: Books are stored in a SQLite database that's accessible from any device on your network!

## ✨ What's New

### ✅ True Cross-Device Persistence
- **SQLite Database**: Reliable database storage instead of simple JSON files
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes appear instantly on all connected devices
- **Offline Support**: Works even when disconnected, syncs when reconnected
- **Multi-Browser**: Access from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - anywhere!

### ✅ Network Access
- **Local Network**: Access from any device on your WiFi network
- **Mobile Friendly**: Use on phones, tablets, laptops
- **Family Sharing**: Multiple people can manage the same book collection

### ✅ Data Reliability
- **Database Transactions**: No data corruption from concurrent access
- **Automatic Backups**: Built-in backup and restore functionality
- **Migration Support**: Automatically migrates from old localStorage data

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start BookTracker with Database
```bash
make run
```

This will:
- Build Docker containers with SQLite database
- Start the API server on port 3001
- Start the web interface on port 8081
- Show network access information

### 2. Get Network Access Information
```bash
make network-info
```

This shows URLs like:
- Local: http://localhost:8081
- Network: http://192.168.1.100:8081 (your actual IP)

### 3. Access From Any Device
1. **On your computer**: http://localhost:8081
2. **On other devices**: http://YOUR_IP:8081 (use IP from step 2)
3. **Add books on any device** - they appear everywhere instantly!

## 🛠️ Management Commands

### Development
```bash
make run           # Start with database persistence
make stop          # Stop containers (data preserved)
make logs          # View application logs
make status        # Check container and volume status
make test          # Test health of all components
```

### Database Operations
```bash
make backup        # Create database backup
make init-db       # Reinitialize database (if needed)
```

### Debugging
```bash
make logs-api      # View API server logs only
make logs-app      # View frontend app logs only
make shell-api     # Open shell in API container
make shell         # Open shell in frontend container
```

### Cleanup
```bash
make clean         # Remove containers (keeps data)
make deep-clean    # ⚠️ WARNING: Deletes ALL data including books!
```

## 🌐 Cross-Device Setup Instructions

### For Family/Multi-User Setup

1. **Start the server** on one main computer:
   ```bash
   make run
   make network-info
   ```

2. **Note the network IP** (something like 192.168.1.100)

3. **On ANY other device** (phone, tablet, another computer):
   - Open any web browser
   - Go to: `http://192.168.1.100:8081`
   - Start managing books!

4. **Test the sync**:
   - Add a book on one device
   - Check another device - it should appear immediately
   - Edit on any device - changes sync instantly

### Network Requirements
- All devices must be on the same WiFi network
- Firewall should allow ports 8081 and 3001
- No special router configuration needed for local network access

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Network Setup
If you need to access from different networks or set up permanent access:

1. **Port Forwarding**: Configure your router to forward port 8081
2. **Dynamic DNS**: Set up a domain name for external access
3. **VPN Access**: Use a VPN to access your home network remotely

### Performance Tuning
For large collections (1000+ books):

1. **Increase Resources**:
   ```bash
   # Edit docker-compose.yml to add:
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
         memory: 512M
       reservations:
         memory: 256M
   ```

2. **Database Optimization**: The SQLite database automatically optimizes for performance

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check if everything is working
make test

# View detailed status
make status

# Check database health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Data Backup Strategy
```bash
# Create manual backup
make backup

# Backups are stored in Docker volume: booktracker-backups
# Access via: make shell-api
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time logs for debugging
make logs

# API-specific logs
make logs-api
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Books Not Syncing Between Devices

1. **Check API Health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://YOUR_IP:3001/api/health
   ```

2. **Verify Network Access**:
   ```bash
   make network-info
   ```

3. **Check Container Status**:
   ```bash
   make status
   ```

### Connection Issues

1. **Firewall Problems**: Ensure ports 8081 and 3001 are open
2. **Network Issues**: Verify all devices are on same network
3. **Container Problems**: Restart with `make restart`

### Database Issues

1. **Corruption**: Very rare with SQLite, but can restore from backup
2. **Performance**: Check disk space and container resources
3. **Migration**: Old localStorage data is automatically migrated
